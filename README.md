# 📊 Bank Loan Prediction using Neural Network

## 📌 About the Project  
This project predicts **bank loan approvals** based on customer details using two neural network models — **Feedforward Neural Network (FNN)** and **TabNet**. It analyzes factors like income, credit score, employment status, and more to classify loan eligibility. The dataset used is **`UniversalBank.csv`**.
